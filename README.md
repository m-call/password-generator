# Password Generator
This application is a password generator that uses prompts to ask the user how many and what type of characters they want in their randomly generated password. The user is able to choose between lowecase, uppercase, numbers, and/or symbols for their generated password.

Upon visiting the webpage and clicking the "Generate Password" button, the user will be first prompted to enter the number of characters they want in their password. The entry must be between 8 and 128, otherwise they will be alerted that they need to enter a value between 8 and 128. Next, they will need to confirm whether or not they want lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and/or special characters. If they choose none of the options, they will be alerted that they must choose atleast one character type. After they have entered a number between 8-128 and have chosen atleast one of the character types, they will be presented a randomly generated password with the number of characters they requested that also includes only the types of characters they requested.
